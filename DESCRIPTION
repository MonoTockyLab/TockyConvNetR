Description: This package provides Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based machine learning methods for analysing flow cytometric data from Fluorescent Timer reporters. Specifically, the package provides random forest-based methods. It is optimised to Timer-of-Cell-Kinetics-and-Activity (Tocky), which enables the analysis of temporal dynamics of individual cells in vivo.
